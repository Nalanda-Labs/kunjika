# kunjika

<h1>What is kunjika?</h1>
<p>Kunjika is a minimal QA/forum application built using Rust, Svelte, Postgres and Redis.</p>
<h3>Is it usable?</h3>
<p>No. It is under active development and not suitable for production.
    It is not even alpha release. Please check
    <a href="https://github.com/Nalanda-Labs/kunjika">github</a> for upcoming releases.
    Once it is stable releases will be made on github</p>
<h3>Is there a binary release for installation?</h3>
<p>There is no binary release nor there is any plan to do so.
    The installation must be done using source code.
<h3>Why another QA?</h3>
<p>It is not about QA/forum only. Most web software is written using inefficient languages
    like PHP, Python, Java, Ruby and so on. It is an attempt to develop a web application
    in Rust which is very efficient and resource-friendly.
</p>
<p>Discourse is very nice forum software but I find it bloated with features but for most
    use cases it should work nicely. If you want a lean/mean QA/forum only then you should
    choose Kunjika. The other reason is the license. Kunjika is true free software under
    GNU GPL and not under some other open source license.
</p>

<p>Kunjika will not integrate with any closed-source applications. Please do not create
issues for such integrations.
